The file american.uspell.dat is a concatenation from scowl-5 english
and american lists, with case-insensitive words capitalized.
See http://wordlist.sourceforge.net/ .

The file hebrew.uspell.dat comes from the hspell source.  Uspell doesn't work
very well on Hebrew, because it doesn't have any way to represent standard
prefixes, such as ו, ה, and ש, which are applicable to almost every word.

The file yiddish.uspell.dat comes from Raphael Finkel's personal word list.
